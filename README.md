# Loan-prediction

1. Utilizing Python libraries for computations (NumPy), data manipulation (Pandas), visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn), and implementing SVM for supervised learning.

2. Loading data from "loan.csv" using Pandas.

3. Exploring and preprocessing the dataset: Checking non-null entries, data types, handling missing values, cleaning (e.g., filling missing values, creating features, variable transformation).

4. Visualizing data: Creating histograms and count plots for distribution and relationships.

5. Data splitting and encoding: Using "train_test_split" for train-test sets, label encoding categorical variables in the training set to prepare for training.
